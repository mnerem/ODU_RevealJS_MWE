# ODU_RevealJS_MWE
A minimal working exampleof RevealJS presentations made with Quarto to experiment with the Seminar plugin

To create a revealjs presentations we will use
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
so that we can write our files in simple markdown files.

Once installed you can render the file with

```
quarto render revealsjs_mwe.qmd --to revealjs
```

You can also create a live preview that updates as you edit the qmd file with

```
quarto preview revealsjs_mwe.qmd --to revealjs
```

Alternatively you can edit the raw html file.
